// Give you result if version of device supported to rate app or not!
InAppReview.isAvailable();

// trigger UI InAppreview
InAppReview.RequestInAppReview()
  .then((hasFlowFinishedSuccessfully) => {
    // when return true in android it means user finished or close review flow
    console.log('InAppReview in android', hasFlowFinishedSuccessfully);

    // when return true in ios it means review flow lanuched to user.
    console.log(
      'InAppReview in ios has launched successfully',
      hasFlowFinishedSuccessfully,
    );

    // 1- you have option to do something ex: (navigate Home page) (in android).
    // 2- you have option to do something,
    // ex: (save date today to lanuch InAppReview after 15 days) (in android and ios).

    if (hasFlowFinishedSuccessfully) {
      // do something for ios
      // do something for android
    }

    // for ios
    // the flow lanuched successfully, The API does not indicate whether the user
    // reviewed or not, or he/she closed flow yet as android, Thus, no
    // matter the result, we continue our app flow.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    //we continue our app flow.
    // we have some error could happen while lanuching InAppReview,
    // Check table for errors and code number that can return in catch.

# + Android guidlelines and notes:

# Read very well:

After publishing you app to test your integration in production or either internal test tracks or internal app sharing and prompt in app review flow you may face issue that not showing review popup after you followed all guidelines very well,
**Note that this issue was classified as google play api issue.**

We found most probably solutions that may be successful to launch review popup:

- Make sure you have installed latest google play store update.
- Note that the popup will not work if you are signed in to the Play Store with a GSuite ID. Once you switch to an @gmail email address, this will start working.
- Make sure there is only one Google account in the test device.
- Please note, that user must be a tester if you are testing on any testing track.
- CLEAR CACHE and CLEAR STORAGE from Google Play Store app.
- Remove existing app rating in Google Play Store.
- after doing all of pervious solutions, remove your app and reinstall it.

# When to request an in-app review

Follow these guidelines to help you decide when to request in-app reviews from users:

- Trigger the in-app review flow after a user has experienced enough of your app or game to provide useful feedback.
- Do not prompt the user excessively for a review. This approach helps minimize user frustration and limit API usage (see the section on quotas).
- Your app should not ask the user any questions before or while presenting the rating button or card, including questions about their opinion (such as “Do you like the app?”) or predictive questions (such as “Would you rate this app 5 stars”).

# Quotas

To provide a great user experience, Google Play enforces a quota on how often a user can be shown the review dialog. Because of this, calling a launchReviewFlow method might not always display a dialog. For example, you should not have a call-to-action option (such as a button) to trigger a review as a user might have already hit their quota and the flow won’t be shown, presenting a broken experience to the user.

# Device requirements

In-app reviews only work on the following devices:

- Android devices (phones and tablets) running Android 5.0 (API level 21) or higher that have the Google Play Store installed.
- Chrome OS devices that have the Google Play Store installed.
